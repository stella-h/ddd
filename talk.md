This talk explores the struggle all of us have faced at some time during our jobs - its not me, it's definitely you, you horrible workplace.

In this talk, we will consider the different situations -- good and bad -- that cause people to leave. We'll identify some of the traits of a toxic work place and figure out why people stay in subpar jobs longer than they should.

And we'll talk about what else is out there, when you do find the right job. Work doesn't have to be miserable!

### what's the story ?

- share 1st experience


The first story I would like to share with you is about a friend of mine called G

    G had been learning how to code by himself for the past 2 years and when he finally landed his first dev job he was so excited could not believe his luck. 6 months into the job, the excitement has worn off. Work was tough and there was alot of pressure from management, but he still think that its manageable. He did not realise that he was in such a hostile environment until he witness his team lead crying over his desk after he came out of a meeting. He knew very well work was bad but that was the last straw. However, he didn't have the confidence to leave. Afterall he was just starting out and getting this job felt like such a lucky fluke. He doubted his skills and to top it all off, he didn't have friends in the industry who could empathize in his situation. But he knew deep down he had to leave no matter what. So he decided to do more hours outside of work to get his skills up to scratch. Eventually he left for a better position, with fewer tears. Not long after, his team lead followed.


    In this case, G did not realise what was a reasonable workload and culture. To top it all off, he did not have acceess to a network of like mided people who he could confide in.


The second story I would like to share with you is about a friend of mine called P.

    P always prides herself in her strong work ethic and she works very hard in every role that she has ever been in. She was excited when she finally landed a role in a prominent tech company. She was 1 of the 2 people in charge of building the whole front end architecture for her team. She was eager to learn and more responsibilites means, better learning opportunities. However, she was frequently being let down as her senior never gave her valuable feedback in regards to her work. He would always say 'That's not the right way to do it' but when she pressed him for more details, he would always say 'I don't know but that's not what the docs says, just read it. Its all there.' She knows that he has lost his passion for technical work, after all he told her 'You know, I never wanted to be a senior. I accepted this role because I wanted to be a PM. If I was a female and I wanted to be a PM, they would have given it to me a long time ago. It's so much easier being a female in tech to go into manegerial roles.'


    In her case, she's hindered by a person in her team not doing their job and being in a role where her superior has clearly has lost his passion.

Another story I would like to share with you is one of my own.

    With this company, it wasn't necessarily toxic but rather it was a situation that I didn't see coming and not one I had signed up for. Over the course of 3 months of joining the company, I noticed that my day to day duties has shifted drastically to what I have been hired to do. I recognise that I had to do something about this situation, and so i decided to bring it up to my reporting manager. He assured me work will be back as usual in no time because we were under the pump to secure another round of investment. I was hired to builts UIs but I was building brochures instead. Weeks passed and soon turned into months.

    At one meeting over the course of several months, he printed out my job description and sat me down to tell me that `your job doesn't require you to write code, we just wanted you to recognise them and read them. Besides you will never be good enough for our engineering team.'

    I realised I will never go back to what I was doing before because 'that work is not a priority right now, we just have to focus on securing this investment'. Although it wasn't in writing, the role has clearly changed and I wasn't necessarily the right person for the job anymore. I realise it was my time go and there's no point sticking around. So i decided to leave with no prospect of the next job.

    I brought up the change of role during my exit interview and he simply said 'well that's the nature of startups, you just gotta do what needs to be done first. We don't have the luxury to pick and choose.'

    Even after I left. I couldn't help but to still feel it's somehow my fault for not being a team player; that I had let them down because I decided to leave instead of doing the work that was expected.

    Fortunately, I found other roles and have been working at several other places including, several other engineering teams.
    So suck it Ben.


    All of the stories I've told you are of people recognising themselves in situations that aren't ideal. The important point to remember is to recognise yourself when you are in that situation and knowing your limits and weather to stay or go.


Remember that quitting is a privillege that not everybody can afford. People can tell you to quit, I can tell you to quit but at the end of the day, you know your situation best. But if you do quit, here's my twitter, please DM me. Bonus points if you say 'stella told me to quit' to your boss.

Have a sounding board. Talk it out with your friend, or whoever you're comfortable with to confirm your theories and validate you feelings. You're not alone and it will help keep you in check. They might even tell you that you're not crazy for feeling that way. Talk to the person next to you for a start.

Much like microservices don't exist in isolation, remember that your actions affect other people. Just because you're bored at your job or you're stuck, it doesn't mean that its exclusively your problem especially if you're in a leadership position. Your actions and opinions still affect other people.

Be supportive. If you do find yourself on the other side giving advice, remember to be kind and try to see it from their point of view.

You can write test for code but you can't write test for your personality.

Be nice to other people. The tech community is so small and you will never know who you could be working for. It could be the colleague that you made fun off for not getting his design systems talk accepted or that person who you made fun of, because she didn't understand how `setTimeOut` worked.

Bet on yourself. But don't bet on yourself too much to the point of quitting your 10th of in a year. Then that's not them, that's you.
If you can land your first role, chances of you landing the second role is equally as high or even higher. Life is too short to be stuck in a shitty job.
