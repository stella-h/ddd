This talk explores the struggle all of us have faced at some time during our jobs - its not me, it's definitely you, you horrible workplace.

In this talk, we will consider the different situations -- good and bad -- that cause people to leave. We'll identify some of the traits of a toxic work place and figure out why people stay in subpar jobs longer than they should.

And we'll talk about what else is out there, when you do find the right job. Work doesn't have to be miserable!

        - not confident enough in their skills
        - thinking that they'll ride it out after talking to management
        - everyone in the industry goes through these situation
        - this is just a rough patch, it will get better in time afterall i've spoken to management.
        - their situation won't allow for them to leave (mentally / financially)

end (summary)
    - reinforce the idea that it's completely normal to want to leave your job.
    - know your worth even if you're in a bad place even if you're a junior you still have something to contribute.
    - remember that we're not doctors/nurses, our jobs are not that important. If civilization falls tomorrow, we'll just be a bunch of nerds who would be so akward in the wild.
    - think and reflect if you're the asshole that's making everyone leave
    -






I have worked in more than 1 place but talked to a bunch of different people which makes me **totally** qualified to do this. **cue laughter** in having said that, we are defintely not alone when it comes to thinking of quitting our jobs - in fact every second there's at least 268 developers thinking of leaving their jobs. (268 devs/second) so we are definitely not alone.

It's human nature to seek out a greener grass however, how do we recognise that it is time for us to seek out greener grass (better job). Or maybe we're not watering our grass enough or plot twist, we're the toxic sludge that's making the grass brown.
