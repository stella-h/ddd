This talk explores the struggle all of us have faced at some time during our jobs - its not me, it's definitely you, you horrible workplace.

In this talk, we will consider the different situations -- good and bad -- that cause people to leave. We'll identify some of the traits of a toxic work place and figure out why people stay in subpar jobs longer than they should.

And we'll talk about what else is out there, when you do find the right job. Work doesn't have to be miserable!

`go from negative to positive? end on positive note ?`

### what's the story ?
- share 1st experience
    - job scope has changed over time
    - i'll never be in the engineering team

    - I would like to share my first experience. With this place, it wasn't necessarily toxic but rather it was a situation that I didn't see coming. I noticed overtime that my day to day duties has shifted drastically to what I have been hired to do. I brought it up briefly to my reporting manager and they assured me work will be back as usual in no time. But weeks passed and it soon turned into months. I realised I will never go back to what I was doing before because 'that work is not a priority right now, we just have to focus on this at the moment'. When I left that role, I brought up this issue during my exit interview and they simply said 'well that's the nature of startups, you just gotta do what needs to be done first. We don't have the luxury to pick and choose.'

    Even after I left. I couldn't help but to still feel it's somehow my fault for not being a team player; that I had let them down because I decided to leave instead of doing the work that's expected.


- share 2nd experience
    - Witnessing my team lead crying on their desk after a meeting with management and pretended nothing had happened the next day.
    I knew work was tough but I though and there's alot of pressures from management but I still think that it was manageable. I did not realise that I was in such a hostile environment until I witness my team lead crying over their desk after they came out from a meeting with management. I knew work was bad but that was the last straw. I didn't have the confidence to leave and I because I was only starting out, I doubted my skills and I didn't really have alot of people who I could talk to regarding my situation. But I knew deep down in my gut I had to leave no matter what so I decided to do more outside of work to get my skills up to scratch. Eventually I left and not long after, my team lead followed.


share 3rd experience

### what did i learn / what should i do in these situations / was there something i could have done better / should i have quit ??
- 1st experience
    - When i first learnt that the job scope has changed from what i was hired to do, I panicked and I couldn't believe that this was happening. I thought i had done enough due dilligence during the interview but it clearly wasn't enough. I did quit because I know if I had stayed in the company, it wouldn't be beneficial to my career development.

### wrap up notes
- remember that quitting is a privillege that not everybody can afford. people can you to quit, I can tell you to quit but at the end of the day, you know your situation best.
- remember to have a sounding board. Talk it out with your friend, or peers. Be honest if you're struggling. It will help keep you in check and you're not crazy for feeling that way.
- you are not alone, your peers are here to help you. twitter famous devs are there to help you and give you advice. tech is filled with garbage people but it's also filled with so many wonderful supportive people.
- Be supportive. If you do find yourself on the other side giving advice, remember to be kind and try to see it from their point of view.
- You can learn how to code but you can't learn to be a nice person. You technical skills gets you through the door but weather you stay or not is your interpersonal skills.
- Be nice. Don't be an asshole.

        - terrible management
        - no transparency / communication
        - repeatedly being let down
        - bullying

middle resolution
    - segueway into why people stay in this shitty jobs?
        - not confident enough in their skills
        - thinking that they'll ride it out after talking to management
        - everyone in the industry goes through these situation
        - this is just a rough patch, it will get better in time afterall i've spoken to management.
        - their situation won't allow for them to leave (mentally / financially)
        - think that what they're going through is normal thus
        - the don't realise they're in a terrible position - no sounding board

    - temporary solution to said shitty work places that was in the example

end (summary)
    - reinforce the idea that it's completely normal to want to leave your job.
    - know your worth even if you're in a bad place even if you're a junior you still have something to contribute.
    - remember that we're not doctors/nurses, our jobs are not that important. If civilization falls tomorrow, we'll just be a bunch of nerds who would be so akward in the wild.
    - think and reflect if you're the asshole that's making everyone leave
    -






I have worked in more than 1 place but talked to a bunch of different people which makes me **totally** qualified to do this. **cue laughter** in having said that, we are defintely not alone when it comes to thinking of quitting our jobs - in fact every second there's at least 268 developers thinking of leaving their jobs. (268 devs/second) so we are definitely not alone.

It's human nature to seek out a greener grass however, how do we recognise that it is time for us to seek out greener grass (better job). Or maybe we're not watering our grass enough or plot twist, we're the toxic sludge that's making the grass brown.
